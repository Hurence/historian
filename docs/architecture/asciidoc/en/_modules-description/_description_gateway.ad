=== gateway

The gateway (or historian server) is implemented with vertx. This server offers a REST API that grafana-historian-datasource uses to trace the
graphs in Grafana. This implies that these two modules are closely linked, if we modify the gateway API this will have an impact on the Grafana datasource and vice versa.
