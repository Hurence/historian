/**
 * This class creates n iterators based on of, called base.
 * These iterators can be iterated on independently.
 * Base must not be touched after being used for Tee.
 * Main idea: There is of queue per iterator created;
 * each queue contains the elements not yet read by this iterator
 * but read from base by somebody else.
 * So, this happens on next ("I" am of of the n Iterators created):
 * If my queue is empty: I get the next element from base and union it to ALL OTHER queues.
 * If !base.hasNext(), then so am I.
 * If not, my queue is not empty. I remove its head and return it.
 * The iterators are created by means of the inner class Aux which implements
 * the iterator interface.
 * Class Tee is for internal use by Iterators only.
